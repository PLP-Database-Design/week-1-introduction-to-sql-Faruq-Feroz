# Question 1
Database Engine: Core component for storing and retrieving data.

Database Schema: Defines the database's logical structure.

Query Processor: Translates and optimizes user queries.

Database Manager: Oversees operations like transactions and access control.

Transaction Management: Ensures reliability with ACID properties.

Data Storage Manager: Manages physical data storage and retrieval.

Concurrency Control: Handles simultaneous access by users.

Backup and Recovery: Protects data and restores it when needed.

User Interface: Tools for users to interact with the database.

Security Management: Controls access and ensures data protection.

# Question2
A relational database stores data in tables (rows and columns) and uses relationships between them for efficient data management.

Examples:

MySQL
PostgreSQL
Oracle Database
Microsoft SQL Server

# Question3
Data Definition Language (DDL):
Used to define and modify the structure of a database.

Examples: CREATE, ALTER, DROP.

Data Manipulation Language (DML):
Used to manipulate data within tables.

Examples: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

Data Query Language (DQL):
Used to retrieve data from the database.

Example: SELECT.

# Question4
A Primary Key uniquely identifies records in a table, while a Foreign Key establishes a relationship by referencing the Primary Key of another table.

# Question5
An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them in a database.

# Question6
Data Accuracy: Ensures consistency and integrity through constraints.

Flexibility: Easy to update and modify data relationships.

Scalability: Handles large volumes of data effectively.

Security: Supports user authentication and access control.

Data Retrieval: Simplifies querying with SQL

# Question7
Integer: Stores whole numbers.
Varchar: Stores variable-length text.
Date: Stores date values.
Boolean: Stores true/false values.

# Question8
The purpose of a Database Management System (DBMS) is to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve data, ensuring data integrity, security, and easy access for users and applications
